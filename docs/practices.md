# Best Practices

1. Give variable, class, Component and file names a strong meaning
2. Respect singular/plural for variable and Component names
3. Capitalize component's file name
4. If Tag is a react component, TagElt is the name of the styles component associated
5. Always run linter and tests before commit or PR
6. Form inputs checks are the frontend responsibility, Be strict and define fields rules into `/forms` with [async-validator](https://github.com/yiminghe/async-validator#rules)
